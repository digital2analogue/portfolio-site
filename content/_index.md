I’ve worn many hats, but been focusing on design systems since 2022. I most notably helped build **OpenTable** and **Capital One's** design systems.

I believe people are core to building good products and successful design systems. I often write about systems for creativity—and analog life—over on my substack. 


I’ve worked at:
- Capital One
- OpenTable
- Epic!
- ExpertVoice
- The Salt Lake Tribune [^1]

My [personal mantra](/preamble/) when it comes to design is that cross-functional collaboration and understanding is key to success.
