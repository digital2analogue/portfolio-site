**My role:** Design Systems Lead  
**Scope:** iOS, Android, Web  
**Team:** 6 product teams


## Overview
OTKit is OpenTable’s design system supporting Restaurant and Diner products across iOS, Android, and web. When I took ownership, the system existed—but lacked cohesion, governance, and trust. Design drift, fragmented sources of truth, and inconsistent adoption were slowing teams down and introducing costly QA issues.

My mandate was not just to redesign components.

It was to **turn a drifting system into an operational platform** teams actually relied on.

---

## The Problem
Design system drift was expensive and invisible.

Research through user surveys and 1:1 interviews revealed:

> We estimated the cost of drift at **~$237K/year** in inefficiency and rework.

---

## Constraints
The system had to evolve without stopping product delivery.

- Six product and platform teams shipping in parallel
- Legacy UI patterns deeply embedded in production
- Cross-platform requirements (iOS, Android, Web)

## Strategy
To stop drift without breaking teams, I focused on **foundations first**, then scaled upward:
1. Tokens before components  
2. Accessible color and typography foundations  
3. Documentation as a first-class system artifact

---

## Foundations: Tokens, Type, Icons
These foundational changes unlocked consistency without forcing large rewrites, making adoption possible across active codebases.

### Color tokens
- Audited and documented all existing colors cross-platform
- Deprecated legacy redundant colors  
- Rebuilt the color system around **accessible, semantic tokens**
- Built "mixed" light/dark theming for existing UI

This resolved cases where critical actions appeared disabled, improved cross-platform parity, and allowed teams to adopt the system without rewriting existing UI.

*Establishing semantic tokens created a single source of truth across platforms and reduced downstream inconsistencies.*

### Contextual typography
The existing type system was a one-size-fits-all scale that:

## Theming in Practice
We delivered multiple system-driven themes:

### Subtitle
- Editorial-style layout
- Two-column structure inspired by e-commerce
- Booking surfaced immediately
- Minimal concepts guiding all components

### Subtitle
- Full-bleed imagery
- Dark wine-inspired time slots
- Sticky, accessible booking flows
- Premium experience without sacrificing usability
