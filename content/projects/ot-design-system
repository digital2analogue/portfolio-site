## Overview
OTKit is OpenTable’s design system supporting Restaurant and Diner products across iOS, Android, and web. When I took ownership, the system existed—but lacked cohesion, governance, and trust. Design drift, fragmented sources of truth, and inconsistent adoption were slowing teams down and introducing costly QA issues.

My mandate was not just to redesign components, but to **turn a drifting system into an operational platform** that teams actually relied on.

---

## The Problem
Design system drift was expensive and invisible.

Research through user surveys and 1:1 interviews revealed:
- **Three competing sources of truth** (Figma, Storybook, internal token sites)
- Visual inconsistencies across products and platforms
- Late-stage QA bugs tied directly to token and component mismatch

We estimated the cost of drift at **~$237K/year** in inefficiency and rework.

> Systems don’t fail because of missing components.  
> They fail because teams stop trusting them.

---

## Constraints
- Six product and platform teams shipping in parallel
- Legacy UI patterns deeply embedded in production
- No mandate authority—adoption had to be earned
- Cross-platform requirements (iOS, Android, Web)

---

## Strategy
I focused on **foundations first**, then scaled upward:

1. **Tokens before components**
2. **Accessibility as a forcing function**
3. **Governance through relationships, not rules**
4. **Documentation as a product**

---

## Foundations: Tokens, Type, Icons

### Color tokens
- Audited and documented all existing colors
- Identified contrast and semantic inconsistencies
- Rebuilt the color system around **accessible, semantic tokens**

This resolved cases where critical secondary actions appeared disabled and improved cross-platform parity.

> Accessibility wasn’t a compliance checkbox—it was how we justified change.

---

### Contextual typography
The existing type system was a one-size-fits-all scale that:
- Was not mobile-optimized
- Encouraged incorrect font usage in native apps
- Had ballooned to **39 fonts in the codebase**

**Solution**
- Introduced a contextual typography scale by platform
- Defined size, weight, and family per context
- Added support for Apple Dynamic Type

**Impact**
A/B testing showed a **+2.19% increase in diner bookings** on pages using dynamic type.

---

### Icon system
- Introduced shape-based icon grids
- Unified keyshapes for indicators
- Centralized icon repositories across platforms
- Added SF Symbol parity for accessibility

This enabled a **searchable, themeable SVG system** for native and web teams.

---

## Brand Evolution: “Black Is the New Red”
OpenTable operates in an industry dominated by red and orange. Partnering closely with Brand, we translated a premium direction into a **tokenized theming architecture** rather than one-off visual treatments.

This enabled:
- Two new font families
- A refreshed color palette
- Visual distinction for Iconic restaurants
- Brand evolution without breaking product consistency

---

## Theming in Practice
We delivered multiple system-driven themes:

### Mass Theme
- Editorial-style layout
- Two-column structure inspired by e-commerce
- Booking surfaced immediately
- Minimal concepts guiding all components

### Iconic Theme
- Full-bleed imagery
- Dark wine-inspired time slots
- Sticky, accessible booking flows
- Premium experience without sacrificing usability

---

## Outcomes & Impact
Over two years, OTKit delivered measurable ROI:

- **25% reduction in QA time**
- **50% fewer Figma libraries**
- **≈ $59K/year reclaimed** in developer time
- Unified design language across 6 teams
- Supported a full OpenTable brand refresh

---

## What Made This Work
- Design ambassadors instead of enforcement
- Documentation treated as a first-class artifact
- Regular demos, office hours, and a system newsletter
- Trust built through responsiveness and follow-through

---

## Reflection
The success of OTKit wasn’t the components—it was the shift in mindset.  
The system became something teams relied on, not something they worked around.

That’s the difference between a library and a platform.
