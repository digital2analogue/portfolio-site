## Overview
I led the redesign of OpenTable’s restaurant reservation details flow—a business-critical interface used daily by restaurant operators. The work modernized a dense, legacy experience while preserving information richness, improving usability, and aligning the product with the evolving OTKit design system.

This project demonstrates how design systems can drive **practical product outcomes**, not just visual consistency.

**My role:** Design Systems Lead, Product Partner  
**Scope:** UX strategy, system alignment, component modeling  
**Team:** 3 designers, 6 engineers, 2 PMs  
**Timeline:** 10 weeks

## The Problem
Reservation details had become a dumping ground for years of accumulated features.

The experience was:
- Dense and visually fragmented
- Difficult to scan under time pressure
- Inconsistent across platforms
- Costly to maintain due to distributed ownership across engineering teams

Despite its importance, it had the **most legacy styling** in the product—making UX improvements slow and risky.

---

## Constraints
- Zero tolerance for data loss or behavioral regressions
- Heavy daily usage by restaurant staff
- Multiple engineering teams owning different parts of the flow
- Need to preserve information density while improving clarity

---

## Strategy
Rather than redesigning the page wholesale, we treated the reservation view as a **modular system problem**.

Key principles:
- Preserve density, improve hierarchy
- Replace bespoke layouts with reusable system components
- Design once, scale across platforms

This allowed us to modernize the experience without disrupting established workflows.

---

## Solution: Modular, Card-Based Architecture
We restructured the reservation details view into a modular, card-based layout that:

- Clarified information hierarchy
- Improved scannability under time pressure
- Enabled consistent behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Reduced one-off UI logic in engineering

Each card mapped to a system pattern, allowing teams to iterate safely and predictably.

## System Alignment
This work became a proving ground for OTKit in real product conditions.

We:
- Applied shared tokens and components across platforms
- Validated cross-platform typography and spacing decisions
- Reduced reliance on custom overrides
- Tightened the feedback loop between system and product teams

The result was faster iteration with fewer regressions.

---

## Outcomes & Impact
- Modernized a core operational workflow without sacrificing density
- Improved readability and hierarchy in a high-stakes, time-sensitive interface
- Reduced QA friction by replacing bespoke UI with shared system patterns
- Strengthened trust in OTKit through visible, high-traffic product adoption

---

## Reflection
Designing for restaurant operators reinforced that usability isn’t about simplification—it’s about **clarity under pressure**.

This work showed how design systems can enable meaningful product improvements without disrupting workflows that teams depend on daily.
